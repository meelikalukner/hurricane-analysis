# hurricane-analysis
Codecademy's Data Science Foundations project

This is one of the projects I did during Codecademy's course "Data Science: Analytics". The project mainly focuses on working with dictionaries. 
There are 2 files within the project: "Hurricane Analysis.ipynb" which is my solution to the proposed questions; and "Hurricane Analyysis_Solution.ipynb" which is Codecademy's proposition to solve the questions.
